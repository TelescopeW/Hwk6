Ranked-Choice Voting
A fair criticism of the electoral system as we know it is “winning by plurality,” which may not represent who (or what) voters in general prefer. To demonstrate this, consider an election in which five candidates Alisa, Robin, Sam, Jake, Dexter are running for office. After the tally, the result is: Alisa = 19%, Robin = 28%, Sam = 20%, Jake = 8%, and Dexter = 25%. Robin wins out with highest percentage (28%) of votes, but is that who the voters really prefer? Indeed a vast majority (72%) of voters preferred someone else!
The problem traces back to the fact that voters only get one choice, but how would an election work if we let voters select multiple options? Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) is one such electoral system that lets voters choose multiple candidates, and it’s gaining steam across the country at all levels of government.
